LOOG
====

An Odoo log parsing and enrichment library and CLI.

Installation
============

For use as a command line tool `pipx <https://pypi.org/project/pipx/>`_
is a good way to install it::

    pipx install "loog @ git+https://github.com/laurent-corron/loog"

The usual installation mechanism with pip also works of course::

   python -m pip install --user "loog @ git+https://github.com/laurent-corron/loog"

Quick start
===========

After installing, running ``loog < odoo.log`` will parse the log and output
enriched JSON records for each log entry.

Log records have the following basic fields:

- asctime
- pid
- levelname: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- dbname
- logger
- message

Enrichment features
-------------------

Detect ``werkzeug`` records for HTTP requests and add the following fields:

- remote_addr
- request_method: GET, POST, ...
- status: 200, 500, ...
- request_uri
- request_path
- sql_count (int)
- sql_time (float)
- other_time (float)
- total_time (float)

Using loog as a library
=======================

develop custom Odoo log processing pipelines.

TODO - document the API.
